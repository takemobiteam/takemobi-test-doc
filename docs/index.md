# Product Overview

The Continuous Planning Service enables TUI’s transfer service to operate efficiently by scheduling, optimizing, and routing TUI’s fleet from advanced pre-planning all the way to day-of operation. 

**[Charlie: Insert product overview diagram]**

# What We're Optimizing For

## Cost Functions

The Continuous Planning System optimizes for cost while following business rules. In order to optimize for cost, we must first define what cost is. Each destination has a specific cost function.

Example 1: Mallorca

Cost = distance travelled



Example 2: Zakynthos

Cost = (# of Vehicle A x cost of vehicle A) + (# of Vehicle B x cost of vehicle B)



In general, destinations where TUI owns their own fleet usually have a simple "distance traveled" cost function like Mallorca, and other destinations that are primarily relying on suppliers have the more complex cost function like Zakynthos.

**[Ask Jacob: Is this how he'd represent Zakynthos cost function?]**

## Business Rules

The Continuous Planning System has been configured with business rules for each destination, in order to comply with local legislation, plan trips that are physically possible given the constraints of the geography, and ensure a great customer experience. The following business rules are applied in most destinations.

| Category            | Business Rule       | Definition                                                   | Usual Value | Specified Where? |
| ------------------- | ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------- | ---------------- |
| Customer Experience | Max time in vehicle | A trip can only take X amount of time. Does not include time from the first/last stop to the airport. Only affects time between first and last hotel stops. (Minutes) | 40          | Master Data      |
|                     |                     |                                                              |             |                  |
|                     |                     |                                                              |             |                  |

# Data Exchange Overview

![Data Exchange Diagram](./attachments/DataExchangeDiagramPurple.png)

1. **Bookings, Flights, & changes:** TUI sends bookings, flights, & changes to Mobi on a continuous basis via an AWS Kinesis stream. All bookings, flights, & changes are sent this way up until the freeze date (e.g. 2 days prior to planned date).
2. **Booking errors:** If there is an error with a booking, this error is sent back to TUI via AWS SNS. An error may be sent immediately after the booking is received, if the booking could not be stored. If the booking can be stored but an error occurs later during planning, the error will be sent when planning occurs (either 14 days prior to the planned date, or soon after receipt of the booking if sent less than 14 days prior to the planned date).
3. **Manual Changes:** After the freeze date (e.g. <2 days prior to planned date), changes must be made manually via API call. This includes new bookings, changes to bookings, new trips, assigning bookings to trips manually, and requesting a replan.
4. **Manual Change errors:** When manual changes are made via API call, there may be errors, which prevent planning & must be addressed. There may also be warnings (which can be ignored if desired) if the manual changes violate QA rules. Both errors and warnings are sent in the API response.
5. **Master Data Request:** Mobi requests master data from TUI from each destination every 15 minutes, via an API call. This ensures that if there are changes on the TUI side (e.g. *NEED EXAMPLE) the changes will be part of Mobi’s planning. Master data includes elements like (e.g. *NEED EXAMPLES).
6. **Master Data:** In response to Mobi’s API call, TUI sends updated master data. (*DOES TUI SEND ALL OF IT? OR ONLY CHANGES?)
7. **Master Data Update Indicator:** If TUI needs the master data to be updated faster than 15 minutes, TUI can call the Master Data Update Indicator API. (*DO THEY EVER CALL THIS?)
8. **Plans & changes:** Mobi sends plans & changes to TUI via an AWS Kinesis stream. TUI consumes this data and displays it in the Ermes system.
9. **Planning complete message:** Mobi sends a planning complete message via AWS SNS (*DOES TUI USE THIS? WHEN & WHY?)

# Bookings, Flights, Changes, & Errors

## Bookings

A booking represents a group of passengers (1 or more) who have booked a tour with TUI together, will be on the same flights, and will be staying at the same hotel. Each booking has properties like destination and number of passengers, as well as flight details.

Bookings generally have the following fields:

- (List out fields)

[Bookings List API, Example, & Schema](https://shiny-enigma-qklzoe7.pages.github.io/#/bookings/bookings_list)

**[To delegate: Validate that auto-generated booking schema matches what TUI sends us for bookings. We want to document TUI's actual interface with us.]**

**[To delegate: Create an example booking with values that illustrate the breadth of what a booking may contain.]**

## Flights

Each flight represents a real flight in the world on a specific day. Multiple bookings may correspond to a given flight. Flights generally have the following fields:

- (List out fields)

## Changes

**[Jacob: How do booking changes work? What does it look like when they get sent? Send a booking & the id is the same & we just replace it?]**

Operations: ([from stream_processors.py])

- Deleted
- Locked

**[To delegate: example booking & booking change]**

## Errors

If there is an error with a booking, this error is sent back to TUI via AWS SNS. An error may be sent immediately after the booking is received, if the booking could not be stored. If the booking can be stored but an error occurs later during planning, the error will be sent when planning occurs (either 14 days prior to the planned date, or soon after receipt of the booking if sent less than 14 days prior to the planned date).



# APIs: Requesting a Replan, Manual Changes, Warnings, & Errors

## Requesting a Replan

After the freeze date that is configured for the relevant destination (e.g. <2 days prior to planned date), Mobi will not replan automatically even if new bookings, changes to bookings, or changes to flights are received. If a replan is needed then it must be requested via an API call. These replan API calls are triggered by buttons in the Ermes interface.

| Ermes Name | Description                                                  | Use Cases                                                    | API Call                                                     |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| New Plan   | Create new vehicles to handle these bookings. Don’t affect anything already created. | Hub: ?<br />Airport: ?                                       | [POST /tui-cps/v1/bookings/replan](https://shiny-enigma-qklzoe7.pages.github.io/#/bookings/bookings_replan_create) |
| Full Plan  | Using existing vehicles, make as many changes as you want, domino effect is fine | Hub: ?<br />Airport: ?                                       | POST /tui-cps/v1/bookings/domino_replan                      |
| Light Plan | System only inserts bookings into existing vehicles with enough space, but doesn't add vehicles or change existing bookings. | Airport: ?                                                   | POST /tui-cps/v1/bookings/insertion_replan                   |
| TBD        | Replan all bookings for the rest of the day without changing vehicles, affecting only passengers & vehicles that have not yet arrived at the airport. | Airport: When a flight gets delayed, ensure the affected passengers get an updated transfer plan, moving other passengers around as needed while minimizing the need to request new vehicles. | TBD                                                          |



## Manual Changes

If the replan buttons cannot meet TUI staff's needs in some circumstances, then they can make manual changes to bookings & trips. These manual changes are made via API calls, which are triggered by buttons & other actions in Ermes.

| Ermes Name                         | Description                                                  | Use Cases                                                    | API Call                                                     |
| ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Bulk Assign                        | Assign bookings to existing trips manually                   | Hub: ?<br />Airport: ?                                       | [POST /tui-cps/v1/trips/{id}/bulk_assign_bookings](https://shiny-enigma-qklzoe7.pages.github.io/#/trips/trips_bulk_assign_bookings_create) |
| Edit Parking Number or Sign Number | Using existing vehicles, make as many changes as you want, domino effect is fine | Hub: ?<br />Airport: Assign parking number or change sign number when vehicle arrives to parking, so that airport employees in other places can direct guests to the right parking area and sign number. Especially useful for big airports, replaces the need for calling on walkie talkies and mobile phones to communicate things like this. | [PATCH /tui-cps/v1/trips/{id}](https://shiny-enigma-qklzoe7.pages.github.io/#/trips/trips_partial_update) |
| Create trip                        | Create new trip                                              | Hub: When receiving new bookings or changes to bookings after the freeze date, create a new trip when needed then use bulk assign to assign bookings to that new trip.<br />Airport: ? | [POST /tui-cps/v1/trips](https://shiny-enigma-qklzoe7.pages.github.io/#/trips/trips_create) |
| Lock                               | Lock a trip so that changes cannot be made by replans        | Hub: ?<br />Airport: ?                                       | POST /tui-cps/v1/trips/lock_trips                            |
| Bulk Unassign                      | Unassign bookings from trips manually                        | Hub: ?<br />Airport: ?                                       | [POST /tui-cps/v1/bookings/bulk_unassign](https://shiny-enigma-qklzoe7.pages.github.io/#/bookings/bookings_bulk_unassign_create) |
| Delete Trip                        | Delete a specific trip                                       | Hub: ?<br />Airport: ?                                       | [DELETE /tui-cps/v1/trips/{id}](https://shiny-enigma-qklzoe7.pages.github.io/#/trips/trips_destroy) |

Miscellaneous questions - check if we covered these:

- Once TUI sends us bookings, how will they know that we successfully planned or didn’t?
- How & when & in what format do we send error messages? (I think we send these via SNS).
- How do we send them back the plans? 
- What happens if they send us too many bookings at once? (like that one time they did this) How many do we expect they will send at maximum in what span of time, so they give us a heads up if they ever plan to send more?
