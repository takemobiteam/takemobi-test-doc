# Data Exchange Overview

![Data Exchange Diagram 1](/Users/charliefarison/git/takemobi-test-doc/docs/attachments/CPSDiagram2.jpg)

1. **Bookings, Flights, & changes:** TUI sends bookings, flights, & changes to Mobi on a continuous basis via an AWS Kinesis stream. All bookings, flights, & changes are sent this way up until the freeze date (e.g. 2 days prior to planned date).
2. **Booking errors:** If there is an error with a booking, this error is sent back to TUI via AWS SNS. An error may be sent immediately after the booking is received, if the booking could not be stored. If the booking can be stored but an error occurs later during planning, the error will be sent when planning occurs (either 14 days prior to the planned date, or soon after receipt of the booking if sent less than 14 days prior to the planned date).
3. **Manual Changes:** After the freeze date (e.g. <2 days prior to planned date), changes must be made manually via API call. This includes new bookings, changes to bookings, new trips, assigning bookings to trips manually, and requesting a replan.
4. **Manual Change errors:** When manual changes are made via API call, there may be errors, which prevent planning & must be addressed. There may also be warnings (which can be ignored if desired) if the manual changes violate QA rules. Both errors and warnings are sent in the API response.
5. **Master Data Request:** Mobi requests master data from TUI from each destination every 15 minutes, via an API call. This ensures that if there are changes on the TUI side (e.g. *NEED EXAMPLE) the changes will be part of Mobi’s planning. Master data includes elements like (e.g. *NEED EXAMPLES).
6. **Master Data:** In response to Mobi’s API call, TUI sends updated master data. (*DOES TUI SEND ALL OF IT? OR ONLY CHANGES?)
7. **Master Data Update Indicator:** If TUI needs the master data to be updated faster than 15 minutes, TUI can call the Master Data Update Indicator API. (*DO THEY EVER CALL THIS?)
8. **Plans & changes:** Mobi sends plans & changes to TUI via an AWS Kinesis stream. TUI consumes this data and displays it in the Ermes system.
9. **Planning complete message:** Mobi sends a planning complete message via AWS SNS (*DOES TUI USE THIS? WHEN & WHY?)

# (Notes to self)

Miscellaneous questions - check if we covered these:

- Once TUI sends us bookings, how will they know that we successfully planned or didn’t?
- How & when & in what format do we send error messages? (I think we send these via SNS).
- How do we send them back the plans? 
- What happens if they send us too many bookings at once? (like that one time they did this) How many do we expect they will send at maximum in what span of time, so they give us a heads up if they ever plan to send more?
